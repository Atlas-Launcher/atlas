# Player troubleshooting

Use this guide when launcher cannot reach a successful Minecraft start.

## Start with Launch Assist

Launch Assist is the primary recovery entrypoint for player issues.

1. Open **Launch Assist** from the failure prompt or sidebar.
2. Complete the top action shown.
3. Retry launch after each completed action.

## Fix readiness blockers

Resolve identity blockers before investigating runtime failures.

- Atlas session expired: sign in again.
- Microsoft session missing: complete Microsoft sign-in.
- Account mismatch: complete the linking prompt again.

## Fix startup and runtime failures

When readiness is complete, use targeted recovery actions.

- Runtime or metadata issue: run the in-app repair action.
- Java/runtime drift: use launcher runtime repair or reinstall path.
- Memory-related crash: increase memory allocation if your pack requires it.

## Escalate with a support bundle

Share a support bundle when guided fixes do not resolve the issue.

1. Export the bundle from Launch Assist.
2. Include what you already tried.
3. Include any visible error text from the last failure.
