# Player getting started

Use this guide once to move from invite link to a confirmed first launch.

## Before you begin

Confirm your environment first so setup does not stall mid-flow.

- Supported platforms: Windows, macOS, Linux (best effort).
- You need an Atlas account and a Microsoft account.
- Install Atlas Launcher if it is not already installed.

## Join a pack from an invite

Start in the web invite page and complete account acceptance.

1. Open your invite link.
2. Sign in or create your Atlas account.
3. Select **Open Atlas Launcher**.
4. If handoff fails, install launcher from the fallback link and retry.

## Complete launch readiness

Launch Assist walks you through blockers one at a time.

1. Sign in to Atlas in launcher.
2. Sign in to Microsoft.
3. Complete account linking when prompted.

## Start Minecraft

When readiness is complete, run your first launch from the Library.

1. Confirm the invited pack is selected.
2. Select **Play**.
3. Wait for the phases: `Syncing pack`, `Preparing files`, `Starting Minecraft`.

## Keep launcher current

Use the in-app update prompt when a launcher update is available.

- Apply updates before retrying repeated launch failures.
- Relaunch Atlas Launcher after an update is installed.

## If launch fails

If Minecraft does not start, switch to the troubleshooting playbook.

- Open `troubleshooting.md` and follow the recovery flow.
